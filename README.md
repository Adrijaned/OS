# AdrijOS
## What's this?
Just an OS, built from asm, C, Rust and potentially others!
## How to run it?
`make run` should do well enough. `make clean` just afterwards.
## What do I need?
 - `gcc`
 - `ld`
 - `nasm`
 - `rustc`
 - `xargo`
 - `genisoimage`
 - `bochs`
 - `make`
 - `rm`
 - linux in general
 - definitely something more I forgot
 - more things I forgot?
